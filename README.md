# Starter for Netlify Workflow

I like to make microsites and vignettes to try out new tech and silly ideas. This is a base for that.

## Create Things
`npm run build` will deploy things FOR SCIENCE (assuming react.js as a base)

## Modify with a non-react app
- Replace react with whatever is needed
- Update the build/directories within netlifi.toml
- Make sure that data is synced with your nelify site settings
